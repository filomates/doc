and as long as the circumference of the ring you want to get.
* A small piece of hard silver solder (700/1000 silver alloy)
* 1/2 spoon Borax powder mixed with 1/4 spoon water
* 4 spoons of citric acid

Tools:
* A rolling mill 
* Semi-flat-nose pliers
* A jeweller's saw
* #0/2 or #0/3 saw blades
* A jeweler's torch or creme brullee burner.
* A #2 half-round file
* Emery paper: 800 grit, 1200 grit, and 2000 grit

* A small paintbrush
* A small glass jar (100-200ml)

>**Tip**
>
>If it's your first ever silver ring, you probably don't have a rolling mill. 
>Try to find a jeweler in your neighborhood and ask them if you could use 
their rolling mill. Most jewelers are happy to see your interest in the trade and let you use it for free.
>You can also try to borrow the rest of the tools from them.
